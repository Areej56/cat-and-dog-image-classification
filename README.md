🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Image Classification

A deep learning image classification project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Python.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on solving a binary image classification problem: identifying whether an input image contains a cat or a dog.
It demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

The model is trained on labeled image data and learns visual patterns using convolutional layers.

🎯 Objectives

Build a CNN-based image classifier

Understand image preprocessing and normalization

Train and evaluate a deep learning model

Predict classes for unseen images

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

OpenCV (optional for image handling)

🧪 Dataset

Dataset contains images of cats and dogs

Images are resized and normalized before training

Labels:

0 → Cat

1 → Dog

Public datasets such as Kaggle’s Cats vs Dogs dataset can be used.

🏗 Model Architecture

The CNN model includes:

Convolutional layers

MaxPooling layers

Flatten layer

Fully connected (Dense) layers

Sigmoid activation for binary classification

▶️ How to Run the Project

1️⃣ Clone the repository
